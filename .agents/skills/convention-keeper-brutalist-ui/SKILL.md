# Brutalist UI Convention Keeper

## Workflow

1. Verify UI components use CSS variables for color and Tailwind v4 syntax.
2. Prefer shared components from `src/ui/shared` where available.
3. Keep naming consistent with file purpose and avoid hardcoded styles.
4. Maintain import ordering and avoid unused imports.

## Output

- Provide a checklist of violations and suggested fixes.
